# NLP Learning Repository

Welcome to my repository for learning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**. This repository showcases my projects as I work towards becoming an NLP specialist, with a focus on freelancing and job opportunities in the Netherlands.

## Notebooks
- **tokenization.ipynb**: Demonstrates text tokenization using the NLTK library in Python.
- **iris_classification.ipynb**: Implements a classification model for the Iris dataset using Logistic Regression in Scikit-learn (accuracy: ~0.97).
- **text_classification.ipynb**: Builds a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 0.666 (work in progress to improve with larger datasets like Twitter Sentiment).

## Goals
- Master NLP techniques for applications like sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text classification.
- Build a strong portfolio for freelancing on platforms like Upwork and applying for data science roles in the Netherlands.
- Contribute to open-source NLP projects and collaborate with the community.

## Skills
- **Programming**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas
- **Techniques**: Text tokenization, Sentiment analysis, Classification
