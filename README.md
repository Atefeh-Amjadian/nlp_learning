# NLP Learning Repository

This repository contains my projects for learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of my journey to become an NLP specialist.

## Notebooks
- **tokenization.ipynb**: Demonstrates text tokenization using the NLTK library in Python.
- **iris_classification.ipynb**: Builds a classification model for the Iris dataset using Logistic Regression in Scikit-learn.
- **text_classification.ipynb**: Implements a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 0.666 (work in progress to improve accuracy).

## Goals
- Master NLP techniques for projects like sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text classification.
- Build a portfolio for freelancing on platforms like Upwork and job applications in the Netherlands.
